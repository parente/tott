Containerization and Docker
===========================

:Author: `Peter Parente <https://github.com/parente>`_
:Builds-on: :doc:`vagrant`

Goals
-----

* Learn about Linux containers
* Learn about a particular container engine: `Docker <https://docker.com>`_
* Understand the potential benefits of containers for application development and deployment
* Practice creating Dockerfiles for reproducible container images
* Practice running Docker containers with links, volumes, etc.

Introduction
------------

Docker is a set of tools for packaging, storing, distributing, and running applications and their dependencies in containers. The Docker container format is application agnostic and may run applications written in any language. Docker containers are also highly portable and can execute on practically any Linux host. The combination helps the migration of apps from development to production by minimizing discrepancies between execution environments.



Exercises
---------

You will need to complete the :doc:`/setup` instructions before you proceed with these exercises. Once you are set up, SSH into *tottbox* using the ``vagrant ssh`` command from the setup instructions. Then tackle the problems below. `Document what you find in a gist <https://gist.github.com/>`_ and share it with the `TotT community`_ later.
